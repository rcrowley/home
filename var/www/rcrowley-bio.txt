Richard keeps the servers happy at Betable.  He's something of a polyglot,
working frequently in C, Go, Java, JavaScript, Puppet, Python, Ruby, and
shell.  He's the creator of the Blueprint configuration management tool, a
contributor to Puppet, and previously worked at OpenDNS and Flickr.  He's
passionate about engineering tools and practice and thinks vi is a better
religion than emacs.
