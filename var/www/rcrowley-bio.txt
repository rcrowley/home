Richard tightens things up as Director of Operations at Slack, almost
certainly the best real-time messaging, archiving, and search tool for
modern teams.  He's part developer, part operator, and gets worked up
easily over configuration management, development enviornments, and
distributed systems.  He's a contributor to Go and Puppet, and was
previously head of operations at Betable and an engineer at OpenDNS and
Flickr.  He thinks vi is a better religion than emacs.
