Richard is Director of Service Engineering at Slack, almost certainly
the best real-time messaging, archiving, and search tool for modern
teams.  That means it's basically his fault if Slack goes down.  He's
part developer, part operator, and gets worked up easily over
configuration management, development enviornments, and distributed
systems.  He's a contributor to Go and Puppet, and was previously head
of operations at Betable and an engineer at OpenDNS and Flickr.  He
thinks vi is a better religion than emacs.
