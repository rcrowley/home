<p>This has happened to me several times and I have never been able to reason or Google an answer.&nbsp; <a href="http://twitter.com/?status=@rcrowley+">@rcrowley</a> on Twitter or email <a href="mailto:r@rcrowley.org">r@rcrowley.org</a> if you know.  (I will not be adding comments to this blog.)</p>
<p>I was in <code>vim</code>(1) and pressed some key combination that likely involved escape or keys near it that caused the &#8216;1&#8217; key to print &#8216;q&#8217;, the &#8216;2&#8217; key to print &#8216;r&#8217;, and so on.&nbsp; The &#8216;0&#8217; key printed &#8216;p&#8217;.&nbsp; The printed character was preceded by a newline.&nbsp; The cursor was placed in front of both characters.&nbsp; <code>vim</code> was otherwise fully functional and the problem happened while the screen indicated I was in insert mode.</p>
<p>This occurred on a remote server, where I was logged in via SSH running within <code>bash</code>(1), running within <a href="http://iterm.sourceforge.net/">iTerm</a>, on OS X 10.5.&nbsp; The problem persisted through exiting and re-running <code>vim</code>, exiting my login shell and re-connecting via SSH, and completely exiting iTerm.</p>
<p>Further, <code>vim</code> run directly under OS X began displaying the same problem.&nbsp; <code>nano</code>(1) did not print any characters when number keys were pressed.&nbsp; OS X GUI applications and <code>bash</code> itself were never affected.&nbsp; <code>vim</code> and <code>nano</code> running within Terminal.app were never affected.</p>
<p>A full OS X reboot restored normal behavior both locally and remotely.</p>
<p>Does anyone know what key combination I pressed?&nbsp; Is this is a bug or expected behavior?&nbsp; If this is a bug, which layer is buggy?</p>
<p><strong>Update 2010-05-17</strong>: It happened again today and by some miracle I only had to restart <code>vi</code> to get back to business.</p>
