			<h2>Katherine&#8217;s childhood home</h2>
			<p>I grew up in the charming town of Winnetka, a suburb just north of Chicago.&nbsp; I have such fond memories of our house on tree-lined Oak Street.&nbsp; My sister Stephanie and I took more than a few walks to the Winnetka Bakery for smiley-face cookies which we had to protect from our brothers, Christopher, Jonathan, and Benjamin. &mdash;&nbsp;<em>Katherine</em></p>
		</li>
		<li id="crowleys">
			<h2>The Crowley residence</h2>
			<p>I grew up in Danville, Kentucky, a town of 15,000 people that all know each other.&nbsp; I can think of no better place to grow up and start my journey west.&nbsp; After a family vacation in 1997 I thought my destination was Seattle and only detoured to San Francisco in 2006.&nbsp; My sisters Charlotte and Caroline, and I try to make it back here to visit our folks as often as we can. &mdash;&nbsp;<em>Richard</em></p>
		</li>
		<li id="hurd">
			<h2>Hurd Hall</h2>
			<p>We met in April of 2005 during <!--Richard&#8217;s-->my sophomore year at Wash U.&nbsp; Katherine was the RA I wish I&#8217;d met sooner. &mdash;&nbsp;<em>Richard</em></p>
		</li>
		<li id="brookings">
			<h2>Brookings Hall</h2>
			<p>Although I was trying to cram for an art history exam on the steps, I was gladly distracted when I bumped into Richard and we stopped to catch up for a while. &mdash;&nbsp;<em>Katherine</em></p>
		</li>
		<li id="rigazzis">
			<h2>Rigazzi&#8217;s</h2>
			<p>On our first date, Richard won me over with his charm, his manners, and of course, his choice of restaurant: an Italian place on The Hill with red gingham tablecloths and food that can&#8217;t be beat.&nbsp; I had the spicy arrabiata, he had the baked Italian sausage pasta.&nbsp; After an eight-hour first date that we didn&#8217;t want to end, we were off to a great start. &mdash;&nbsp;<em>Katherine</em></p>
		</li>
		<li id="first-apartment">
			<h2>First apartment in San Francisco</h2>
			<p>After a year and a half apart with many visits between San Francisco and Saint Louis, Katherine was finishing graduate school and moving west.&nbsp; We spent one of her weekend visits checking out every neighborhood in town, settled on Russian Hill, and found an apartment with a killer view of the Golden Gate Bridge but a tiny kitchen. &mdash;&nbsp;<em>Richard</em></p>
		</li>
		<li id="proposal">
			<h2>Proposal in Aix-en-Provence</h2>
			<p>On our first big vacation together, we went for a long hike in the beautiful countryside of Provence.&nbsp; After getting back to town and finding a charming park for our picnic, I thought Richard was digging around in his bag for some goat cheese and handi-wipes.&nbsp; Instead, he pulled out something much better! &mdash;&nbsp;<em>Katherine</em></p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<ul id="sf">
		<li id="alamo-square">
			<h2>Alamo Square</h2>
			<p>A great picnic spot and home of the famous Painted Ladies, the six awesome Victorian houses you may recognize from the opening credits of Full House.&nbsp; Just down the hill from here is Hayes Valley, a great place for dining and shopping.</p>

		<li id="alta-plaza">

		<li id="blazing-saddles">
			<h2>Blazing Saddles</h2>
			<p>Though San Francisco is full of hills, a bike ride is a fantastic way to see the city.&nbsp; This places rents bikes by the hour and provides maps for rides along the bay and over the Golden Gate Bridge, to Sausalito, and beyond.&nbsp; Or ask us about our favorite route through the city, known affectionately as the Butter Loop.</p>

		<li id="louies">
			<h2>Louie&#8217;s</h2>
			<p>If you&#8217;re exploring the western part of the city, walk the Land&#8217;s End trail, climb around the ruins of the Sutro Baths, and definitely stop by this diner that&#8217;s been overlooking the Pacific Ocean since 1937.</p>
		</li>
		<li id="marin-headlands">
			<h2>Marin Headlands</h2>
			<p>Directly across the Golden Gate bridge are the Marin Headlands where you can hike, bike, or visit Rodeo Beach.&nbsp; The 18-mile loop that overlooks the city for a few miles is one of our favorite bike rides.</p>

			<h2>Powell Street Cable Car Turnaround</h2>
			<p>The southern end of the cable car is in Union Square, home to basically all the shopping in San Francisco.&nbsp; The Hyde Street line takes you through Russian Hill (our neighborhood) on the way to Lombard Street and Fisherman&#8217;s Wharf.</p>

		<h2>Wedding Party</h2>
		<h3>Katie Anderson &amp; Mike Malone</h3>
		<p>Richard met Mike through a mutual friend shortly after we&#8217;d both moved to San Francisco.&nbsp; They became friends over many an argument about computers and as luck had it, Katie and I hit it off when I joined Richard in San Francisco.&nbsp; Last year they moved to Russian Hill and we love having such close friends so close by.&nbsp; We&#8217;re excited to have these two as Maid of Honor and Best Man. &mdash; <em>Katherine</em></p>
		<h3>Alexa Guerra &amp; Mike Panchenko</h3>
		<p>Mike (&#8220;Pancakes&#8221;) and I worked together for a few years at Wash U.&nbsp; When he graduated, he and Alexa moved to San Francisco and fit right in with the rest of us.&nbsp; When they moved to Russian Hill, Alexa inaugurated our long-running tradition of taking turns hosting Sunday night dinner parties.&nbsp; The bridal party wouldn&#8217;t be complete without these two. &mdash; <em>Richard</em></p>
		<h3>Stephanie Fawkes</h3>
		<p>Stephanie is my younger and technically (by half an inch) taller sister.&nbsp; People used to confuse us for twins when we were younger and we continue to take advantage of that today.&nbsp; I&#8217;m thrilled to have her be a part of the wedding. &mdash; <em>Katherine</em></p>
		<h3>Matt Tanase</h3>
		<p>Matt and I met through his previous company and over the course of more than a year met up when he was in San Francisco, bounced ideas around, and eventually started DevStructure together.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve become great friends while working together and I&#8217;m glad he could be a part of the wedding. &mdash; <em>Richard</em></p>
		<h3>Zeke Goggin</h3>
		<p>Our eloquent officiant Zeke is a friend of mine since high school.&nbsp; He came quickly to mind as the best man to lead us through our vows. &mdash; <em>Richard</em></p>

			<h2>Presidio Social Club</h2>
			<p>It&#8217;s only appropriate for our reception to be in a restaurant.&nbsp; The Presidio Social Club was at one time a barracks and now serves brunch and dinner in one of the most beautiful places in San Francisco.</p>
            <h3>Ceremony and reception</h3>
            <p>Please arrive by 11:30am for the ceremony.&nbsp; The reception will immediately follow with lunch, drinks, and dancing.</p>
            <h3>Directions</h3>
            <p>The Presidio is located at the northern tip of San Francisco.&nbsp; The Presidio Social Club is just inside the Lombard Street entrance.&nbsp; Direct your cab driver to Lombard and Lyon (pronounced like the animal), enter the Presidio through the Lombard Gate, and take an immediate left at Ruger Street.&nbsp; The Presidio Social Club will be visible on your right.&nbsp; Follow the map above or enter <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=563+Ruger+Street,+San+Francisco,+CA&hl=en&ll=37.79734,-122.44415&spn=0.009682,0.014355&sll=37.798456,-122.451816&sspn=0.00242,0.005633&hnear=563+Ruger+St,+San+Francisco,+California+94123&t=m&z=16">563 Ruger Street</a> into your GPS.</p>
            <h3>Parking</h3>
            <p>There is free parking in front of and behind the restaurant and along the tennis courts nearby.&nbsp; If that fills up, continue west on Lombard, turn right on Presidio Boulevard, and try the first two lots you come across.&nbsp; Or, if you&#8217;re up for a challenge, you can try your parking luck in the neighborhood along Lyon Street.</p>
