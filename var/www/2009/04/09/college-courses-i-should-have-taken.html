<h1><a href="/2009/04/09/college-courses-i-should-have-taken">College courses I should have taken</a> <small>2009/04/09</small></h1>
<p>Yesterday, I read through A List Apart&#8217;s 2008 Survey and the
Relevance of Education <a id="f-09-1-src" href="#f-09-1" class="footnote">[1]</a>
section tricked me into reflecting on my time at Wash U.&nbsp; My professors
taught me all about performance and time complexity, data structures,
operating systems, circuits and hardware architecture (I am a hardware
designer by education).&nbsp; All of this, save the direct design of new
hardware, has been immensely helpful in my first two years as a Real
Boy&trade;.</p>

<p>Since yes-or-no questions are kind of boring, I reflected further on
what my college education lacked&nbsp;&mdash; courses I wish I&#8217;d
taken.&nbsp; While I was working for Flickr and recruiting for Yahoo!, I
spent a part of each visit to Wash U encouraging the Computer Science
department to get serious about web programming.&nbsp; The result was an
ostensibly senior-level course that guided students through LAMP, Rails,
databases and JavaScript plus the protocols/standards they build upon:
HTTP, HTML and CSS.&nbsp; It was a great addition to the program and
I hope it&#8217;s still around.&nbsp; Though I&#8217;ve not kept up
my course-list evangelism, I now have several more courses I wish I&#8217;d
taken.</p>

<h2>Network algorithms</h2>
<p>The algorithms course that I took focused on efficient computation on
a single node.&nbsp; Wash U offered an Advanced Algorithms course that, in
retrospect, I should have taken.&nbsp; I hope such a course covers
network-aware algorithms like map/reduce, gossip and P2P protocols,
queuing and distributed hash tables (Chord
<a id="f-09-2-src" href="#f-09-2" class="footnote">[2]</a>, etc.).&nbsp; These topics
become required knowledge when you start talking about &#8220;Internet
scale&#8221; anything.</p>

<h2>Managing disk I/O</h2>
<p>This course definitely doesn&#8217;t exist.&nbsp; Academics are big fans
of pretending they have infinite I/O capacity but they do students a
disservice by hand-waving one of the largest time-sinks in all of
computing.&nbsp; I have learned a lot by reading papers and blog posts
produced by my more experienced peers and even more by
trial-and-error.&nbsp; Topics for such a course include write-ahead logs
(and all of the other things InnoDB does), <code>aio</code> and its effect
on performance plus some time to address concurrency as it pertains to
disk performance.&nbsp; Engineering school should prepare people for reality
and I can&#8217;t thing of anything more real than <code>iowait</code>.</p>

<h2>Lock-less data structures</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m not certain this doesn&#8217;t exist at Wash U.&nbsp; The
Drizzle mailing list <a id="f-09-3-src" href="#f-09-3" class="footnote">[3]</a>
made mention of lock-free data structures, a topic I haven&#8217;t given
much thought to beyond using <code>concurrent_hash_map</code> from the
Intel TBB <a id="f-09-4-src" href="#f-09-4" class="footnote">[4]</a>.&nbsp; Not
surprisingly, the design of these libraries is difficult and
theoretical&nbsp;&mdash; you have to <em>prove</em> correctness since so
much is left to chance.&nbsp; Academics love proofs, right?</p>

<h2>OS kernels</h2>
<p>I took Wash U&#8217;s senior-level Operating Systems course but never
got around to taking the graduate-level version.&nbsp; The former focused
on <code>libc</code>, system calls, threading and writing programs that
behave like UNIX programs.&nbsp; The latter dives into the Linux kernel
itself.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t anticipate becoming a kernel hacker anytime
soon but having deep knowledge on the design of the Linux kernel would
definitely make me a better software architect.</p>

<h2>More econ</h2>
<p>I took up through intermediate microeconomics and wish I had learned
more.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have the solutions to the world&#8217;s problems
and I still wouldn&#8217;t even if I knew more but I would understand
the expert&#8217;s opinions more thoroughly.</p>

<p>Anything I&#8217;m missing?&nbsp; I&#8217;m curious what others wish
they&#8217;d taken in college, especially those who have been at it
professionally for more than two years.</p>
