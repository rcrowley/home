<h1><a href="/2008/04/08/starting-at-opendns-today">Starting at OpenDNS today</a> <small>2008/04/08</small></h1>
<p>There are so many things to love about Flickr and especially about working at Flickr that I initially thought myself crazy for even considering leaving.&nbsp; But with time came sanity and I saw the pros for leaving start to outweigh the cons.</p>
<p>The folks at Flickr are without a doubt the most talented group I've ever had the honor of working with and I will miss them all.&nbsp; Flickr as a whole is a dream, a place with passionate staff matching passionate members and no shortage of new ground to break into, but my piece of this puzzle was not exactly right for me.&nbsp; I developed the new Flickr Uploadr desktop client as an open-source, extendable app for getting your photos and metadata onto Flickr.&nbsp; The project had everything I wanted &mdash; new technology, technical difficulty, performance concerns, design quirks and the goal of open-source extendability.&nbsp; But for all of that it had a fatal flaw &mdash; I am not a desktop software developer.</p>
<p>Thinking more forwardly, "I am not a desktop software developer" started to say what I really meant: "I do not want to be a desktop software developer."  Selfish personal preference.</p>
<p>This job at OpenDNS has all the ingredients of a good time in my book &mdash; C++, maybe some map/reduce, I/O bottlenecks, oh-my-god-databases-are-slow and a whole lot of networking (the TCP/IP kind).&nbsp; The people there are awesome just like Flickr's and I have no doubt I'll become just as attached to them.</p>
<p>(Housekeeping: it looks like the XULRunner saga on rcrowley.org has come to an end for the time being.&nbsp; I almost guarantee I'll be back to dabbling with it sometime, though, since it'd be a shame for all that practice to go to waste.&nbsp; Don't count on Windows XPCOM, though.)</p>

		<p>Congrats buddy!</p>
<p>I think you've made a big impact while at Flickr and I've no doubt you'll do great things at OpenDNS. Dave's lucky to steal you =)</p>

		<p>What language is flickr uploader written in?&nbsp; It kicks ass.</p>

		<p>Haha. Don't lie. You left because Yahoo is going to be snatched up by Microsoft and fire all of our asses.</p>

		<p>@Choppen5: It's written in Haskell.&nbsp; Since it's GPLv2, you can see if I'm telling the truth by downloading the source from http://www.flickr.com/tools/uploadr/</p>

		<p>[...&nbsp; I guess they also want to use it to hire a new XUL guru because the author of their new Uploadr, Rich Crowley, has left and is now working for OpenDNS. [...]</p>
