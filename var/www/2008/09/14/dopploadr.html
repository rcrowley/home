<h1><a href="/2008/09/14/dopploadr">Dopploadr at Yahoo! Open Hack Day</a> <small>2008/09/14</small></h1>
<p>My hat's off to Yahoo! for putting on a great show this weekend.&nbsp; More
than one person told me how much more excited they are about Yahoo! after
experiencing Hack Day.&nbsp; It really does bring out the best in everyone.
Plus, the Girl Talk set Friday night was killer.</p>

<p>MikeD and I showed up proudly wearing our OpenDNS t-shirts and were
taken aback by the number of excited OpenDNS users we encountered &mdash;
thanks, guys.&nbsp; Mike did the vast majority of the work on our main hack,
a reworking of the OpenDNS Guide to use Yahoo!'s BOSS search API.&nbsp; We're
excited about the prospects of integrating our user's preferences directly
into search results.&nbsp; My part in all of this was to wrangle the markup
and CSS.&nbsp; We really could roll this out next week and we wanted it to look
that way.&nbsp; In the demo, Mike mentioned (casually) that we could throw a
few million queries per day at BOSS.&nbsp; We aren't kidding.</p>

<h2>Enough OpenDNS, tell me about the cheating</h2>

<p>Before I sat down to crank out the eye-candy for the OpenDNS Guide, I
built an extension for the Flickr Uploadr.&nbsp; But <strong>I wrote the Flickr
Uploadr</strong>.&nbsp; This is totally cheating.&nbsp; I'd like to think that the
Flickr judges felt the same way and that's why I didn't win any prizes but
it doesn't matter because some people I really admire graciously complimented
my work and I expect it will see quite a bit of day-to-day use.&nbsp; I hope it can
also serve as a good starting point for future extensions.&nbsp; Without further
ado:</p>

<h2><a href="http://dopploadr.rcrowley.org/">Dopploadr</a></h2>

<p>Dopploadr is an extension for the open-source, Mozilla-based Flickr
Uploadr.&nbsp; As I said in the demo, it works just like a Firefox extension
because it is.&nbsp; The Uploadr includes Mozilla's Extension Manager.</p>

<p>Once you install Dopploadr, Uploadr will take you to Dopplr to
authenticate.&nbsp; My apologies for the copy &amp; paste step but there's
no equivalent of <code>flickr.auth.getToken</code> in the Dopplr API.
One other catch that should be mentioned is that Dopplr's API must be
accessed over SSL and (at Yahoo! and during my demo, at least) their
servers or certificates frequently and randomly fail.&nbsp; Try again.</p>

<p>Once you're authenticated, there's really no UI to it.&nbsp; The status
bar will indicate you're signed in, saying "Dopploadr for rcrowley"
or some such but the real magic happens behind the scenes.&nbsp; Each time
Uploadr thumbnails a photo, it hands off the date-taken field during the
<code>after_thumb</code> event and Dopploadr decides where you were at
that time, noting the latitude/longitude and some tags like:</p>

<ul>
	<li>danville</li>
	<li>ky</li>
	<li>unitedstates</li>
	<li>woe:id=2389342</li>
	<li>geonames:locality=4289445</li>
	<li>dopplr:trip=207163 (if you were on a trip)</li>
</ul>

<p>When you upload a batch, Uploadr will again be really secretive but Just
Work.&nbsp; The <code>before_one_upload</code> event will combine the user's tags
with the geo tags above and then let Uploadr continue with the upload.&nbsp; When
Uploadr finishes, it hands off the photo's ID to Dopploadr during the
<code>after_one_upload</code> event so Dopploadr can call
<code>flickr.photos.geo.setLocation</code> with the stored
latitude/longitude.</p>

<p>My official monkeypatch count sits at 3.&nbsp; First was adding the
<code>after_logout</code> event that I still haven't actually used (see also
version 0.2).&nbsp; Second was a short walk around the DOM to insert Dopploadr's
string bundle (strings accessible from JavaScript).&nbsp; Third was adding a
counter for outstanding Dopplr API calls and making the
<code>buttons.upload.enable()</code> method sensitive to the count to prevent
uploading before everything's been geotagged.</p>

<p>Here's the photo I uploaded during my demo:  <a
href="http://flickr.com/photos/rcrowley/2853699765/"
>http://flickr.com/photos/rcrowley/2853699765/</a>.
(See, it really works!)</p>

0.1</a></big> or <big><a href="http://github.com/rcrowley/dopploadr">check
out the code on GitHub</a></big>.</p>

<p>My sincerest thanks once more to the folks all over Yahoo! that made Hack
Day happen.</p>

		<p>I'm really excited to hear that OpenDNS will be using Yahoo! BOSS.&nbsp; I think that will present some interesting opportunities and show the power of using BOSS in a corporate environment.&nbsp; I wish I had thought of that idea.</p>

		<p>Dopploadr was a really smart hack. Good work!</p>
<p>Also, the OpenDNS hack was quite nice, too. Love your guys' service. Keep up the great work.</p>

		<p>Since you know all of the Flickr staff, the prizes might not have been that useful to you :)</p>
<p>But *awesome* hack, none the less. I'm really glad at least a few people realized how cool machine tags are.</p>

		<p>On Uploadr 3.1 (a special video build I got from the Flickr forums), the statusbar says 'Dopploadr ready for (null) (1)'. There is only one suspicious error in the console:</p>
<p>Error: l is null
Source File: chrome://dopploadr/content/overlay.js
Line: 58</p>

		<p>@Brian: That issue should be fixed in the master branch and the new 0.1.1 build.&nbsp; Thanks for pointing it out.&nbsp; Shoddy error checking on my part.</p>

		<p>Nice hack. I've been working on something that sort of does the same thing, but with images already on Flickr.</p>
<p>This does lead me to a slight issue- some of photos I'm tagging already have location data. Obviously I don't want to overwrite that, so I won't, but I am considering using a dopplr:woeid= machine tag (to make it clear that's where the trip was), so that the user can keep (or add their own) woe:id= tag later. Would you be open to doing the same?</p>

		<p>Until recently we were suffering from http://davidsmalley.com/2008/6/22/firefox-3-triggers-an-openssl-bug - an openSSL interaction bug with firefox 3, and I know it was causing API problems. Let me know if you're still seeing issues.</p>
<p>Great tool, by the way.</p>
