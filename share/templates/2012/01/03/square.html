<p>Today is my first day at Square.&nbsp; I&#8217;m joining the infrastructure team there to help automate whole datacenters, build APIs to real hardware, smooth out deployment, and probably much more along the way.&nbsp; I&#8217;m very excited to return to working on scalability and performance problems on a pretty highly-trafficked API.&nbsp; (When you spend all your time writing configuration management software, you tend not to manage any servers.)</p>

<p>Blueprint will remain an open-source configuration management tool that I maintain, newly decoupled from any business interests.&nbsp; In fact, I just merged the S3-backed Blueprint Server into <a href="https://github.com/devstructure/blueprint/commits/master"><code>master</code></a>.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been about two years since Matt and I set out to build heavily automated development environments and stumbled into a new configuration management workflow.&nbsp; I can&#8217;t understate how much I&#8217;ve learned about both engineering and startups in that time.&nbsp; For now, though, I want to spend my time engineering and not selling or searching for consulting work.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s hip to be (a) square.</p>
