<p>I have been writing a lot of Go lately at <a href="https://betable.com">Betable</a> and the channels of channels pattern comes up so often that I broken down and benchmarked it.&nbsp; I&#8217;m publishig this more widely at the insistence of Paul Hammond who would agree that this is yet another of the many and persistent reminders that Rob Pike is smarter than I am.</p>
<p>In summary, it is faster to allocate a one-time-use channel for a goroutine to acknowledge a request than to use a <code>sync.Mutex</code>.<p>
