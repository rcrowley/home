</header>
<p>As part of an effort to learn hands-on about DevStructure&#8217;s potential customers, I&#8217;ve started working with small companies helping with their Puppet infrastructure and general operational polish.&nbsp; It became quickly clear to me that tracking my time in TextMate was a losing proposition so I took a late evening to whip up Git Paid.</p>
<p>Git Paid includes three programs.&nbsp; <a href="http://rcrowley.github.com/gitpaid/gpbegin.1.html"><code>gpbegin</code>(1)</a> and <a href="http://rcrowley.github.com/gitpaid/gpend.1.html"><code>gpend</code>(1)</a> mark the beginning and end of a work session by making commits to a Git repository.&nbsp; By default, this repository is <code>~/.gitpaid</code> but it can be overridden by the <code>GITPAID_REPO</code> environment variable or the <code>-r</code> option.&nbsp; Likewise the default branch is <code>master</code> but it can be overridden by the <code>GITPAID_BRANCH</code> environment variable or the <code>-b</code> option.</p>
<p><a href="http://rcrowley.github.com/gitpaid/gpinvoice.1.html"><code>gpinvoice</code>(1)</a> tabulates the time spent in all work sessions and generates a nice work summary, which includes all the commit messages given to <code>gpbegin</code>(1) and <code>gpend</code>(1) with the <code>-m</code> option.&nbsp; It respects that not all hours are billable so the <code>-t</code> option to <code>gpend</code>(1) will cause <code>gpinvoice</code>(1) to count an arbitrary amount of time for that session.&nbsp; For example:</p>
<pre>
$ gpbegin -b client-name
$ ...
$ gpend -b client-name -m "Shaved the yak."
$ gpbegin -b client-name
$ gpend -b client-name -t 1:45 -m "Faked the time."
$ gpinvoice -b client-name
